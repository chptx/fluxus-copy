; this is another example of a different rendering technique, not toonshading styleb
; lighting, but similar approach which can be used to find edges

; instead of doing a lighting calculation, we figure out the viewing angle (the direction from the
; eye to the vertex on the object) and work out how much the normal of the vertex faces the viewer - 
; the facing ratio. we then use this to map the texture, so that the gradient wraps from the edges 
; to the middle of the object
