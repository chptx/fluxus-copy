0.9

* osc fix
* blur works for coloured backgrounds
* (searchpath '("path/to/textures" "path/to/scripts" "path/to/scripts2" "path/to/etc"))
* ctrl-x with no selection no longer eats random bits of your script!
* characters not supported by the editor are now represented by yellow blocks, rather than
troublesome invisible entities
* decent camera rotation control with left mouse
* delete/backspace switched for the mac build
* (osc-msg) now stores all messages in a fifo
* (wire-colour colour)
* hide mouse on ctrl m
* locators for all the joints on (show-axis 1)
* (build-fixedjoint obj)
* rotations work with the physics system properly now
* (turtle-push) (turtle-pop) turtle state stack
* (hint-vertcols)
* (get-transform) when not used between a (grab) and (ungrab) this returns the 
current transform from the stack
* save with text highlighted now safe (saves all rather than selection)
* (full-path) searches the searchpaths and returns a fullpath, or the filename 
if not found
* (hint-box) renders object bounding box
* (clip front back) sets the clipping plane positions, defaults to 1 10000
* (frustum top bottom left right) sets screen area, defaults to -0.75 0.75 -1 1
* (hint-multitex) turns on multitexturing
* (multitexture n texture) loads a texture into multitexture slot n.
* orthographic fixes - mouse zoom works, editor projection fixed



0.8

* fixed object picking (mouse-over)
* framedump 
    * memory leak fixed
    * outputs jpg files rather than tiff
    * uses 6 character frame no filenames (so we can save over 6 minutes
of animation :)
* no more portaudio! fluxus now uses jack directly. 
* (smoothing-bias) a kind of weighted average for the harmonic bands
which smooth them out over time. this setting was hardcoded before (to
1.5) but the best setting really depends on the quality of the music,
and ranges from 0 -> 2. it's obvious if you give it a try with the
bars.scm script
* (oscsend) now takes a type string, so you can differenciate between
floats and ints in a message
* (has-collided) returns true if the currently grabbed object collided
with another object in the last update
* (pdata-op "operator" a b) a one call operator for pdata - performs
operation on all values in the pdata array at once. speeds up rendering
of a particle system of 5000 particles from 20fps (looping through each
particle in scheme the old way), to running at 60fps using pdata-op on
my old laptop.
* (grab)/(ungrab) fixed properly - calling (push) or (pop) when an
object is grabbed will cause it to be ungrabbed and print a warning
* polys can be now be rendered in wireframe only (seems this wasn't
working before)
* (fog colour density start end) sets global fog (density to 0 to
disable)
* (selectable bool) whether an object is selectable by (mouse-over)
* (blend-mode src dest)
* (force-load-texture texturefilename)
* (build-seg-plane) takes x,y tesselation values and builds a poly plane
* added a new mode to the particle primitive so you can render textured
sprites (I'll be expanding it a little more to allow different sized
sprites etc)
* (recalc-normals) works for polygons, and smoothes the normals
* lots of fixes to the editor
* some misc bugs fixes with gl state
* html documentation with pics (cheers to Nik for helping out)


0.7

overhauled the osc support (osc-msg) (osc) (osc-peek)
operations for matrix and vector types in scheme
primitive (set) and (get) for changing per vert primitive values (pdata)
(get-transform) returns grabbed object transform matrix in world space
nurbs objects
(hide)
(draw-instance)
(get-camera-transform)
(build-nurbs-sphere) (build-burbs-plane)
removed flocking stuff - should be a toplevel script
more error checking
(build-text)
new library of useful scheme code 
	primitive operations (pop.scm)
		(pop-deformer)
		(pop-shade)
(engine-callback) renamed to (every-frame)
(frame) removed and replaced with (time) and (delta)
(line-width) fixed
added: 
(build-hingejoint)
(build-sliderjoint)
(build-amotorjoint)
(joint-param)
big document update
loads more scripts, including live ones
more editor features

0.6

scons build system
OSC support with (start-osc) and (from-osc)
new physics commands: (gravity), (set-mass) and (surface-params)
removed fltk
removed fluxface
Built in OpenGL editor
multiple editor workspaces
changed occurances of _ to - in scheme functions to match standard
fftw3 support
decent error reports from guile (still go to commandline)
keyboard support improved
more scripts, including a game.scm example

0.5

assert build error fixed
"Insufficient GL support" error in fltk fixed
texture loader only caches one copy of each texture
much faster retained mode scenegraph lookups
fullscreen mode ("f" or "w" in renderer window)
fps clamping
init $HOME/.fluxus.scm sourced on startup
(start_framedump) (end_framedump) tiff framesave
F5 without text selected executes all
commandline script load
(build_line)
(random) changed to (flxrnd)
(getharmonic) now wraps the harmonic no. so you always get something
(source) loads and executes scripts
(clear_fluxface) crash fixed
fluxface bug fixes and tidy ups
physics groundplane crash fixed
(make_light) and light descriptions
sphere builder fix
parentheses highlighting - good idea for scheme ;)
lock camera works again
polybuilder turtle (normals not working yet, use wireframe hints)
(collisions) allows you to turn off ode collisions - defaults off
(process) for offline wavfile processing

0.4
split up into libfluxus, libfluxphysics and main app
fixed newbie texturing errors - should be much faster
added ambient and emmisive to the materials (shaded f+b)
smoothed cylinders
fixed spheres 
fixed problem with fltk-gl depth buffer
fixed active_sphere
tex coords for spheres
clear clears engine callback
portaudio replacement for jack/oss
