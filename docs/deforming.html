<h1>10.0  Deforming primitives</h1>
Deformation in this chapter signifies various operations. It can involve 
changing the shape of a primitive in a way not possible via a transform (ie 
bending, warping etc) or modifying texture coordinates or colours to achieve a
per-vertex effect. (Deformation in this way is also the only way to get particle
primitives to do anything interesting).

Deforming is all about pdata, so, to deform an entire object, you do something like 
the following:

<c>(hint-unlit)
(hint-wire)
(line-width 4)
(define myobj (build-sphere 10 10))

(define (deform n)
    (pdata-set "p" n (vadd  (pdata-get "p" n)                ; the original point, plus
        (vmul (vector (flxrnd) (flxrnd) (flxrnd)) 0.1)))     ; a small random vector
    (if (< n 0)
        0
        (deform (- n 1))))
    
(grab myobj)
(deform (pdata-size)) ; for every point
(ungrab)</c>

when deforming geometry, moving the positions of the vertices is not usually enough, 
the normals will need to be updated for the lighting to work correctly. 

<c>(recalc-normals smooth)</c>
will regenerate the normals for polygon and nurbs primitives based on the vertex 
positions. not particually fast (it is better to deform the normals in your 
script if you can) and only works on poly primitives of type QUADS and TRILIST.
if smooth is 1, the face normals are averaged with the coincident face normals to
give a smooth appearance

when working on polygon primitives it will cache certain results, so it will be
a lot slower on the first calculation than subsequent calls on the same 
primitive.

<big>10.1 User PData</big>

As well as the standard information that exists in primitives, fluxus also allows 
you to add your own per vertex data to the primitive. User pdata can be written 
or read in the same way as the built in pdata types.

<c>(pdata-add name type)</c>
where name is a string with the name you wish to call it, and type is a one 
character string consisting of:

f : float data
v : vector data 
c : colour data
m : matrix data

<c>(pdata-copy source destination)</c>
this will copy a array of pdata, or overwrite an existing one with if it already 
exists.

So, adding your own storage for data on primitives means you can use it as a fast
way of reading and writing data, even if the data doesn't directly affect the 
primitive.

<c>(define particle-count 1000)

(define (init n)                                       ; setup our pdata arrays
    (pdata-set "vel" n (vmul (vsub (vector (flxrnd) (flxrnd) (flxrnd)) 
        (vector 0.5 0.5 0.5)) 0.1))                    ; randomise the velocity
    (pdata-set "c" n (vector (flxrnd) (flxrnd) 1))     ; randomise the colour
    (if (< n 0)
        0
        (init (- n 1))))

(define (update n)
    (pdata-set "vel" n (vadd (pdata-get "vel" n) (vector 0 -0.001 0))) ; add some gravity
    (pdata-set "p" n (vadd (pdata-get "p" n) (pdata-get "vel" n)))     ; add velocity to the position
    (if (< n 0)
        0
        (update (- n 1))))

(define (render)
    (grab ob)
    (update (pdata-size))                              ; update the particles
    (ungrab))

; setup the scene
(clear)
(show-fps 1)
(point-width 4)
(hint-anti-alias)

; build our particle primitive
(define ob (build-particles particle-count))

(grab ob)
(pdata-add "vel" "v") ; add the velocity user pdata of type vector
(init (pdata-size))   ; initialise the pdata arrays
(ungrab)
(blur 0.1)

(every-frame "(render)")</c>

<big>10.2 PData Operations</big>

Pdata Operations are a optimisation which takes advantage of the nature of 
these storage arrays to allow you to process them with a single call to the 
scheme interpreter. This makes deforming primitive much faster as looping in 
the scheme interpreter is slow, and it also simplifies your scheme code.

<c>(pdata-op operation pdata operand)</c>
where operation is a string identifier for the intended operation (listed below)
and pdata is the name of the target pdata to operate on, and operand is either
a single data (a scheme number or vector (length 3,4 or 16)) or a name of another 
pdata array.

If the <c>(update)</c> and <c>(render)</c> functions in the script above are 
changed to the following:

<c>(define (update)
	(pdata-op "+" "vel" (vector 0 -0.002 0)) ; add this vector to all the velocities
    (pdata-op "+" "p" "vel")) ; add all the velocities to all the positions

(define (render)
    (grab ob)
    (update)
    (ungrab))</c>
	
On my machine, this script runs over 6 times faster than the first version. 

<c>(pdata-op)</c> can also return information to your script from certain 
functions called on entire pdata arrays. 

Pdata operations

"+"       : addition
"*"       : multiplication
"sin"     : writes the sine of one float pdata array into another
"cos"     : writes the cosine of one float pdata array into another
"closest" : treats the vector pdata as positions, and if given a single vector, 
            returns the closest position to it - or if given a float, uses it as a 
			index into the pdata array, and returns the nearest position.

For most pdata operations, the vast majority of the combinations of input types 
(scheme number, the vectors or pdata types) will not be supported, you will 
receive a rather criptic runtime warning message if this is the case.
		
<big>10.3 Using PData to build your own primitives</big>

The function (build_polygons) allows you to build empty primitives which you 
can use to either build more types of procedural shapes than fluxus supports 
natively, or for loading model data from disk. Once these primitives have been 
constructed they can be treated in exactly the same way as any other primitive,
ie pdata can be added or modified, and you can use (recalc-normals) etc.
