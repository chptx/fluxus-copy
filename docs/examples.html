<h1>5.0 Examples</h1>
The examples show you a quick roundup of features and are probably more useful 
than the documentation for getting an idea of what you can get working with 
fluxus. They range from simple test scripts to a little game, and should be
commented to some extent for you to get an idea of whats going on.

A note on relative paths, many of the scripts load textures, and use paths 
relative to the examples directory, so launch fluxus from there for best 
results.
