<h1>5.0  Global Options</h1>
These commands affect the global state, and can be called at any time.

<c>(clear)</c>
clears the scene graph of all objects and empties the state stack.

<c>(ortho)</c> or <c>(persp)</c>
sets the projection type to either othographic or perspective projection.

<c>(frustum top bottom left right)</c>
sets screen area, with this you can set the aspect ratio for the render. defaults to -0.75 
0.75 -1 1

<c>(clip front back)</c>
sets the clipping plane positions, defaults to 1 10000

<c>(reset-camera)</c>
resets the camera matrix in case you get lost.

<c>(lock-camera object)</c>
locks the camera to the object.

<c>(clear-colour colvec)</c>
set the background clear colour.

<c>(clear-frame 0|1)</c>
enables/disables clearing.

<c>(blur amount)</c>
turns hackish motion blur on, just renders a transparent poly over the frame 
rather than clearing. the transparency is set by amount, setting amount to 0 
turns this feature off. 

<c>(show-axis bool)</c>
turns the origin axis display on or off.

<c>(backfacecull 0|1)</c>
enables/disables backface culling.

<c>(desiredfps fps)</c>
sets a maximum fps setting so fluxus doesn't max out cpu usage all the time. 
this value doesn't seem to be entirely correct, but it does the job.

<c>(start-framedump filename type) </c>
<c>(end-framedump)</c>
starts and stops writing tiff frame images to disk. will be quite slow - and 
unsuitable for realtime use - see <c>(process)</c> type can be one of "tif" or
"jpg".

<c>(fog colour density start end)</c>
sets the global fogging parameters.

<c>(feedback 0|1)</c>
turns on a background plane which is textured with the previous frame, for those wacky 70's video 
effects. be warned - this is slow and probably won't work as advertised on large frame sizes, and 
buggy and prone to crashing!

<c>(feedback-transform matrix)</c>
sets a transform for the feedback plane

<c>(searchpaths l)</c>
sets the directories in which fluxus will search for files (textures and scripts) to the given 
list of paths, in order

<c>(fullpath filename)</c>
returns the full path to the file, using the searchpaths
