<h1>8.0  The appearance of primitives</h1>
Now that we have primitives and lights for shading them, it's time to introduce 
the ways that you can modify the appearence of your primitives.

<big>8.1  Surface parameters</big>

These surface parameters can be treated exactly like the rest of the state 
items - transforms, (colour) etc. They can either be set using the state stack 
when building primitives, or set later using (grab)

<c>(opacity n)</c>
set the opacity value on the current state 

<c>(wire-colour n)</c>
set the wireframe colour on the current state 

<c>(specular v) </c>                       
set the specular colour on the current state 

<c>(ambient v)</c>                         
set the ambient colour on the current state

<c>(emissive v)</c>                        
set the emissive colour on the current state

<c>(shinyness n)</c>                       
set the shinyness on the current state

<c>(texture n)</c>                         
set the texture on the current state, using a texture ID

Textures are loaded using (load-texture filename), they are cached so they 
won't load more than once, so you can easily just call:

<c>(texture (load-texture "path/to/mytexture.png"))</c>

Textures have to be png format, and support alpha transparency.

<c>(multitexture n t)</c>  (only on poly prims at the moment)                       
set the texture on the current state, using a texture ID n to multitexture t. 
multitexturing allows you to apply different textures and coordinates to the 
same object at once. t is a number from 0 to 7. texture 0 is the default one
(which uses the pdata "t" for it's texture coords) multitexture n looks for 
pdata "tn" - ie multitexture 1 looks for "t1". you need to add these 
yourself using (pdata-add) or (pdata-copy). see <a href="deforming.html">deforming</a> for
more info.

<c>(line-width n)</c>

alters the line width in pixels

<c>(point-width n)</c>

alters the point width in pixels

<c>(blend-mode src dest)</c>

sets the blend mode for the primitive's alpha blending function, src and dest 
are strings of the following type:

zero
one
dst-color  
one-minus-dst-color
src-alpha		   
one-minus-src-alpha
dst-alpha
one-minus-dst-alpha
src-alpha-saturate (src only)

<big>8.2  Render hints</big>

There are other miscellaneous options that can change the way a primitive is 
rendered. These options are called hints, as for some primitives they may not 
apply, or may do different things. They are mainly useful for debugging, or 
special cases - sometimes just for some fun.

4 pixels

<c>(hint-none)</c>                         
clear the current render hints

<c>(hint-solid)</c>
render solid - defaults to on

<c>(hint-wire)</c>
render wireframe representation

<c>(hint-normal)</c>
render normals, very handy

<c>(hint-points)</c>
render vertex or cv points

<c>(hint-anti-alias)</c>
render antialiased mode

<c>(hint-unlit)</c>
disable lighting

<c>(hint-box)</c>
renders the object's bounding box

<c>(hint-vertcols)</c>
uses vertex colours for the object, switches off colour materials from (colour) 
command

<c>(hint-multitex)</c>
turns on multitexturing - only works on poly primitives at the moment
