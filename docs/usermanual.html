<h1>3.0  User Manual</h1>
Fluxus consists of one window containing a script editor rendered on top of the 
scene display render. The idea is that you only need the one window to build 
scripts, or play live. f5 is the key that runs the script when you are ready. 
Selecting some text (using shift) and pressing f5 will execute the selected 
text only. This is handy for reevaluating functions without running the whole 
script each time.

<big>3.1  Camera control</big>

The camera is controlled by moving the mouse and pressing mouse buttons.

Left mouse button: Rotate
Middle mouse button: Move
Right mouse button: Zoom

<big>3.2  Workspaces</big>

The script editor allows you to edit 10 scripts simultaneously by using 
workspaces. To switch workspaces, use ctrl+number key. Only one can be run at 
once though, hitting f5 will execute the currently active workspace script. 
Scripts in different workspaces can be saved to different files, by using the 
<c>(save-name)</c> call in the different workspaces (see below).

<big>3.3  Keyboard commands</big>

ctrl-f : Fullscreen mode.
ctrl-w : Windowed mode.
ctrl-h : Hide/show the editor.
ctrl-s : Save current script.
ctrl-0 to 9 : Switch to selected workspace

<big>3.4  Loading/Saving scripts</big> 

Scripts can be loaded by typing:

<c>(edit "examples/bars.scm")</c>

and hitting F5. The script you just typed will be replaced by the loaded script.
Scripts are saved by hitting ctrl-s - the filename is either set to the last 
loaded script, or overwritten by:

<c>(save-name "newsavename.scm")</c>
