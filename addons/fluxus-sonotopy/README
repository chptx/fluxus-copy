FLUXUS-SONOTOPY

This module integrates with Sonotopy, a library for perceptually
analyzing an acoustic signal in real time, e.g. for visualization of
music. Sonotopy consists of methods to extract high-level features
from an acoustic waveform. These numeric feature values can be
interpreted as e.g. shapes, colors or motion parameters.
fluxus-sonotopy acts as a layer between Jack, Sonotopy and Fluxus.
For examples, see the examples/ directory.
