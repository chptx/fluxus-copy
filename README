Fluxus : (C) 2007 Dave Griffiths : dave at pawfal dot org : www.pawfal.org

"act of a flowing; a continuous moving on or passing by, as of a flowing stream; 
a continuous succession of changes"

Fluxus is a small realtime render engine for linux that generates animation from 
sound. Released under the GPL licence (see COPYING)

Installing
----------

Fluxus is a dependancy heavy application, and installing it can be a bit of a 
challenge - anyone who can help in this regard (debian packages etc), please get 
in contact!

It requires:

ode (0.5)           http://opende.sourceforge.net/
plt scheme (4.x)    http://www.plt-scheme.org/ (from source - see below)
fftw (3.0.1)        http://www.fftw.org/
jack (1.0)          http://jackit.sourceforge.net/
libsndfile (1.0.12) http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
liblo (0.5.0)       http://plugin.org.uk/liblo/
glew (1.3.4)        http://glew.sourceforge.net/
libfreetype (2.2.1) http://www.freetype.org/
libalsa             http://www.alsa.org/

The version numbers in brackets are the version I've built it with, later versions
should also be ok, let me know (via the mailing list) if you run into problems.

And if that's not enough, you'll also need scons (http://www.scons.org/) to 
actually build fluxus.

PLT install instructions
------------------------

You probably need to install PLT from source, in order to get shared libraries
like this:

./configure --enable-shared --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install

Fluxus install instructions
---------------------------

To build and install, type:

scons 
sudo scons install

Build options to scons are:

X11=1
Build with the X11 libraries - rather than Xorg which is default.			 

MULTITEXTURE=1
Multitexturing is bad tempered on some drivers - set this to enable the 
multitexturing code.		 

GLSL=0
Set this to disable GLSL hardware shaders.

STEREODEFAULT=1
Use hardware stereo rendering

ACCUM_BUFFER=1
Startup with an accumulation buffer (again, bad tempered on some drivers)

There are more settings at the top of the SConstruct file which may need to be
tweaked to correctly find things.

Fluxus install instructions for OS X
------------------------------------

Install PLT Scheme binary (http://download.plt-scheme.org/) and
MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/).

Put the bin directory of PLT Scheme and MacPorts to your path by adding
the following line to the .bash_profile file in your home directory:

PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin:/Applications/PLT\ Scheme\ v4.1.4/bin/

You might need to change the PLT Scheme version number according to
the binary package you have installed.

Install dependencies from MacPorts:

sudo port install fftw-3 glew freetype jack jpeg liblo libpng libsndfile ode scons tiff zlib

To build and install, type:

scons
sudo scons install

If you have an older graphics card (Mac mini or older MacBook model), you might
need to build and install Fluxus with

scons MULTITEXTURE=0 GLSL=0
sudo scons MULTITEXTURE=0 GLSL=0 install

It is also possible to build an OSX application of Fluxus by typing:

scons --app
./macos/osx_app-postbuild.sh

Please note that at the time of writing the application only works if it is
copied to the /Applications folder.


It is also possible to build an OSX application of Fluxus.
The application is built using JackOSX (http://www.jackosx.com/) instead of
MacPorts jack. Make sure to install it before building the application.

To build, type:

scons --app
./macos/osx_app-postbuild.sh

Please note that at the time of writing the application only works if it is
copied to the /Applications folder.


Using fluxus
------------

See docs/fluxus-documentation.txt, the online help and most importantly the 
example scripts (in the examples directory) for pointers on using fluxus.

Load the examples on the commandline by running "fluxus scriptname.scm" or 
loading them from inside fluxus by pressing ctrl-l and browsing.
